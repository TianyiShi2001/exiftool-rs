# exiftool-rs
a na√Øve wrapper around Phil Harvey's ExifTool

# Prerequisite

You must install [Phil Harvey's ExifTool](https://exiftool.org) first. Make sure `exiftool -h` shows the help page.

# Examples

For now, run:

```bash
cargo run --example read
```

which is an example that shows how to read and show all Exif tags in a photo.

I'm the author of the photos used in the examples, so please do not re-distribute those photos without my permission.
